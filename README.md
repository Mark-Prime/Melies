# Méliès

A Rust built, GUI focused, remake or Ryukbot v2.

## Goals

_Ryukbot v2_ was designed to make recording Team Fortress 2 footage as automated as possible while still allowing some freedom in how that automation worked, however, it's entirely command line interface made it confusing or even hard to use for some people. _Méliès_ looks to change that by creating a faster and easier to understand system. With [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) doing all of the heavy lifting, we won't need to rely on pythons relatively slow speeds to process everything. The GUI built with [Svelte-Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) also has the goal of making the program as easy to understand and customizable as possible, allowing users to see and edit their settings without needing a text editor to edit a JSON file.

### A Trip to the Moon

[Georges Méliès](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s) was a French illusionist and film that took audiences from the Earth to the Moon back in 1902. I'm hoping this little program helps people unleash their own imaginations, just like Georges Méliès did all those years ago.

## Getting Started

If you are familiar with Ryukbot or Ryukbot v2, a large amount of the program will feel similar but with the addition of a GUI.

A more detailed guide will be made in the future.
